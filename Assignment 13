Cloud Security
Over the last week, you created a highly available web server for XCorp's Red Team to use for testing and training. Now, your lead cloud administrator has asked for a diagram of the Network that you created to keep for documentation and company records. Your task is to use draw.ioLinks to an external site. to create a detailed diagram of your cloud infrastructure.

Cloud Recap
Once you've completed all of the cloud week activities, you should have:

A at least two VMs running DVWA.

All DVWA VMs are receiving traffic from your load balancer.

You can complete this assignment with either two or three VMs.

Your Goal
When you are finished with this assignment, you should have a network diagram that shows your entire cloud setup, including your Ansible jump box and the Docker containers running on each VM.

You can use this document as part of a portfolio to demonstrate your ability.

Instructions
Use a free account at draw.ioLinks to an external site. to diagram the entire cloud network that you created this week.

Your diagram should show the following:
Azure resource group
Virtual network with IP address range
Subnet range
Flow of specific traffic (e.g., HTTP, SSH)
Security group blocking traffic
Load balancer
All VMs that you have launched including host names and IP addresses (internal and external where applicable)
Where Docker and Ansible are deployed
