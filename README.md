# Cloud-Security-and-Virtualization
Module 13: Introduction To Cloud Computing, Cloud Systems Management, Load Balancing and Redundancy

Module Description
The Cloud Security and Virtualization module will introduce cloud computing service models, cloud networking, firewalls, and virtual computing.
Over the next four classes, we will build a basic cloud network using virtual machines (VMs) and containers.

Module Objectives

Day 1: Introduction To Cloud Computing

Distinguish between cloud services and identify an appropriate service depending on an organization's needs.

Set up a virtual private cloud network.

Protect their cloud network with a firewall.

Deploy a virtual computer to their cloud network.

Day 2: Cloud Systems Management

Access their entire VNet from their jump box.

Install and run containers using Docker.

Set up Ansible connections to VMs inside their VNet.

Day 3: Load Balancing and Redundancy

Write Ansible playbooks to configure VMs.

Create a load balancer on the Azure platform.

Create firewall and load balancer rules to allow traffic to the correct virtual machines.

Day 4: Testing Redundant Systems


Verify redundancy by turning off one or more virtual machines used in the infrastructure


Can be used as a catch-up day to finish activities from the previous days in Cloud Security.

Lab Environment
For the majority of demonstrations and activities, the class will use Microsoft Azure cloud services and the Azure cloud portal.

You will not be using any of the Azure lab environments. Instead, you will be using personal Azure accounts.

You should have already created a free account on Microsoft Azure before the beginning of class. Please make sure you are signed into your own personal Azure account and not the lab environments.

Refer to the the Setup Guide and Azure Free Tier FAQ's if needed.

What to Be Aware Of:

âš  Heads Up : This week is a cumulative lesson. Each day's work builds on the previous day. Therefore, you cannot miss a day and continue on to the next lesson without getting caught up. If you miss one of the four days, you will need to let the instructional staff know so they can help you prepare.

Important: During these classes, you will need to generate Secure Shell (SSH) keys. Please remind any students that are using a Windows machine that they should have downloaded and installed GitBash on their machine. GitBash should be used to follow all SSH instructions for these modules.

Security+ Domains
